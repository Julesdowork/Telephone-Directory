# Telephone-Directory
A program to lookup names and numbers in a telephone directory

This simple Java program reads a list of 1000 phonebook listings
from a text file, and stores them in a telephone directory. Users
can then lookup individual people by name or by number. If looking
up by number, make sure the user doesn't include punctuation (such
as (, ), -, or spaces) and just types the number in naturally
(1234567890).
